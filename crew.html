<section>  <h1 class="C" style="color:grey;">Tobey Maguire</h1>
<h3 class="D">playing as Peter Parker</h3>

<p class="B">Tobias Vincent Maguire was born in Santa Monica, California. His parents were 18 and 20, and not yet married,
  when he was born. His mother, Wendy (Brown), did advertising, publicity, and acting in Hollywood for years as
  she coached and managed Tobey. His father, Vincent Maguire, was a cook and sometimes a construction worker.
  Tobey did not finish high school in order to pursue and focus on acting roles, but he did end up getting his GED.
   He did several commercials (he was a model dancer for Nordstrom by age six), and he had some roles on various TV shows
   before landing a starring role on the Fox comedy Great Scott! (1992). That role lasted nine weeks before the show was
  canceled. Fox-made series were not doing well in general at the time. He avoids drugs and alcohol, and his best friend
   is Leonardo DiCaprio. Tobey is a vegan and studies yoga. He now has two beautiful children with his wife Jennifer Meyer Maguire.
  Their names are Ruby Sweetheart and Otis Tobias Maguire. Another little known fact is that his two half-brothers, Jopaul and
    Weston Epp, were the child actors who handed Tobey (Peter Parker) his mask after the train scene in Spider-Man 2.

<section> <h1 class="C" style="color:dark grey;">Stan Lee</h1>
  <h3 class="D">as comic book writer, editor, publisher and producer</h3>

  <p class="B"> Stan Lee was an American comic-book writer, editor, and publisher, who was executive vice president and publisher of Marvel Comics.

Stan was born in New York City, to Celia (Solomon) and Jack Lieber, a dress cutter. His parents were Romanian Jewish immigrants.
 Lee co-created Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor, the X-Men, and many other
 fictional characters, introducing a thoroughly shared universe into superhero comic books. In addition, he challenged the comics' industry's censorship
  organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics
   from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.

He had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, with many yet to come, posthumously.
 A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in the creation of certain characters.

On 16 July 2017, Lee was named a Disney Legend, a hall of fame program that recognizes individuals who have made an
extraordinary and integral contribution to The Walt Disney Company.

Stan was married to Joan Lee for almost 70 years, until her death. The couple had two children.
 Joan died on July 6, 2017. Stan died on November 12, 2018, in LA.
